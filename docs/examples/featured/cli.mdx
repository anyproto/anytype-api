# Anytype CLI

## Overview

The Anytype CLI is a command-line interface that embeds [anytype-heart](https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-heart) to run Anytype as a headless server. It can be used for automation, server deployments, and running Anytype as a background service.

## Features

- **Headless Operation** - Run Anytype without a GUI, perfect for servers and automation
- **Cross-Platform Service** - Install as a background service (launchd, systemd, Windows)
- **Bot Accounts** - Create dedicated accounts for automations and integrations
- **Space Management** - Join, leave, and list spaces from the command line
- **API Key Generation** - Create and manage API keys for programmatic access
- **HTTP API** - Exposes the full Anytype API at `http://127.0.0.1:31012`

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
/usr/bin/env bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyproto/anytype-cli/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run the server interactively
anytype serve

# Or install and run as a background service
anytype service install
anytype service start

# Create a bot account
anytype auth create my-bot

# Generate an API key
anytype auth apikey create my-integration
```

Once running, the HTTP API is available at `http://127.0.0.1:31012`. Use your API key to authenticate requests:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:31012/spaces" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
     -H "Anytype-Version: 2025-11-08"
```
