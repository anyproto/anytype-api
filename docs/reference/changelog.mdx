Stay up to date with the latest API changes and improvements.

## 2025-05-20

New authentication endpoints, stable type/property keys, rate limiting, and built-in SVG icons.

### Added

- New authentication endpoints:
  - `POST /v1/auth/challenges` for creating new challenges
  - `POST /v1/auth/api_keys` for exchanging challenge code for API key
- Support for built-in SVG as type icons
- Stable type and property keys: You can now specify these keys when creating or updating types and properties. They must be unique and follow camel_case formatting.

### Changed

- Burst rate limiting (sustained 1rps, burst size 60) with option to disable via `ANYTYPE_API_DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT=1` environment variable
- Switched creation endpoints to return StatusCreated (201) instead of StatusOk (200)
- Improved API key generation system
- Removed ExportService dependency, now using RPC for exports

### Fixed

- Request body format for `POST /spaces/:space_id/lists/:list_id/objects`
- Emoji input validation checks
- `GET /spaces/:space_id/lists/:list_id/views/:view_id/objects` now works with built-in type queries

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `format` from `PropertyLinkWithValue` for improved efficiency
- Authentication endpoints (`/v1/auth/display_code`, `/v1/auth/token`) will be deprecated in favor of new challenge-based system in the future
- Added required subresource `views` to path `/spaces/:space_id/lists/:list_id/:view_id/objects [get]` for retrieving objects in a list view

  - `PATCH /spaces/:space_id/properties/:property_id/tags/:tag_id`
  - `DELETE /spaces/:space_id/properties/:property_id/tags/:tag_id`

- Return linked `properties` (featured and from sidebar) and `plural_name` for types

### Changed

- Renamed `recommended_layout` to `layout` for types
- Moved `description` and `source` to `[]properties` in `CreateObjectRequest`
